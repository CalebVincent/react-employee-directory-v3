# React Employee Directory

[Link to deployed site](https://calebvincent.github.io/react-employee-directory-v3/)

## Getting Started

When you load the program a predetermined list of employees will be displayed, along with a filter and sort button across the top. The filter button will cause employees with the state intelligent : false to be hidden. The sort button will rearrange the employees so that the first employee entered in the code will be displayed first at the top, descending down to the last employee entered in the code, reflecting which employee has worked the longest.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Technologies Used

JSX / CSS
